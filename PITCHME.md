### Blockchain
## Blockchain principle
* A user wants to pay another user some bitcoins, he broadcasts a transaction to the network.
* Miners add the transaction as they receive it to their current block, the one they are currently working on.
* Randomly, one of the miner may win the lottery and "mine" the block (we'll get back to that).
* At that moment, this new "definitive" block is broadcasted to the network and added to averyone's copy of the blockchain.
